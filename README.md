---simple version of a brain in my mind---
The overall functions of a brain are mainly not included. 
It's more like the parts of the brain that I think can be constructed like different modules and collaborate together to be able to complete some tasks that we used to think
that need human intelligence.
The list may be incomplete and it's open to any advice and discussions
